    "AboutMe": "Hi there! As a recent graduate with a passion for back-end development, I'm excited to pursue a career in software engineering.  During my internship, I was tasked with developing and maintaining the back-end of a complex web application, and I loved every minute of it which solidified my passion for programming.   While I appreciate the importance of front-end development, my true passion lies in the back-end, where I can apply my technical expertise to create efficient, scalable, and reliable systems.  I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges, and I work well both independently and as part of a team.  I'm excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a new opportunity in software development, and I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team.",
